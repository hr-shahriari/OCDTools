## What Can It Do?
### Duplicate Component
- What It Does: Makes a copy of a component or set of selected components but without the wires that go into it.
- Why Use It: Handy for using the same component again somewhere else in your script without messy wires.

### Get Merged Inputs
- What It Does: If you have lots of wires going into one input, it makes things neater by using a Merge component.
- Why Use It: Makes your script less cluttered and easier to understand.

### Mass Connect & Append Inputs
- What It Does: Connects many outputs from one component to inputs of another component automatically.

### Duplicate Group
- What It Does: Makes a copy of a group of components and places it below the original.
- Why Use It: Just to have duplicate groups perfectly aligned:).
