# OCD Tools for Grasshopper
## What Is This?
OCD Tools is a set of tools for Grasshopper to help users easily and quickly organize their Grasshopper scripts.
## What Can It Do?
### Duplicate Component
- What It Does: Makes a copy of a component or set of selected components but without the wires that go into it.
- Why Use It: Handy for using the same component again somewhere else in your script without messy wires.
### Get Merged Inputs
- What It Does: If you have lots of wires going into one input, it makes things neater by using a Merge component.
- Why Use It: Makes your script less cluttered and easier to understand.
### Mass Connect & Append Inputs
- What It Does: Connects many outputs from one component to inputs of another component automatically.
### Duplicate Group
- What It Does: Makes a copy of a group of components and places it below the original.
- Why Use It: Good for using the same set of components again while keeping your script organized.
